## Description

The purpose of this app is to display places I've travelled to with key details about each visit, incuding a photo of the location, a link to view the location on Google Maps, the date visited and a short description of what the location is. Using the form at the bottom of the screen, users can create a new journal entry that is saved in local storage.

I designed this app to get better at using props in React and added TypeScript to practise that as well.

### TO DO

-   add back-end so new journal entries aren't just stored locally
